# go-auditd
An auditd log parser/analyser built in Golang because why not?

---
I decided to start building this out of frustration of there being really nothing on the open-source market for analyzing auditd logs
at all, closest I got was LOGalyzer but that was not fun to work with at all, so here we are.

This tool is obviously under construction and right now I'm just focusing on getting it some what functional for the purposes of ~~a college assignment related to auditing~~ yeah, so I've been told I can't use it for that assignment, but regardless I'm still going to work on it.

So don't expect anything pretty (or 100% secure) right off the bat, first step is to get something that actually works for my purposes first.
